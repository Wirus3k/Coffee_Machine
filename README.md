# Coffee Machine Final code of Project with stages:coffee::robot:

### Stage :one:<br />
Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!
### Stage :two:<br />
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.
### Stage :three:<br />
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.
### Stage :four:<br />
Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
### Stage :five:<br />
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.
### Stage :six:<br />
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
